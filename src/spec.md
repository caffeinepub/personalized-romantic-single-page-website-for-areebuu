# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page romantic apology website addressed to “Areebuu”, with a consistent non-blue/purple visual theme, at least four sections, and at least two lightweight interactions.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page layout with at least 4 distinct sections: Hero (prominent “Areebuu” headline), Message, “Little things I love about you”, and a Closing call-to-action section.
- Write all user-facing text in English, including a sweet apology-style message, and prominently include the exact nicknames: “Areebuu”, “Linnuu”, “cutie potato”, and “kuchhuu puchhu”.
- Add at least two interactive UI elements (mobile/desktop friendly) such as reveal/tap interactions, a small carousel/cards, and/or a “Forgive me?” choice that results in a friendly outcome either way.
- Apply a coherent, distinctive design system (colors, typography, spacing, component styling) consistently across the page, avoiding a predominantly blue/purple theme.
- Add and render generated static images from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (e.g., background/hero/decorative elements) with no backend usage.

**User-visible outcome:** A romantic single-page site for Areebuu that displays an English apology message with the specified nicknames, shows a themed sectioned layout, includes at least two playful interactions, and features embedded romantic visuals.
